            For over a decade, I&apos;ve dedicated my career to creating spaces where young people
            and those working with them can thrive. My work is driven by a simple but powerful
            belief:{' '}
            <strong>
              every child, staff member, and family deserves access to high-quality youth
              programs—no matter who they are, where they come from, or how they identify.
            </strong>

            Compassion and intentionality are at the heart of everything I do. As a social worker,
            youth development specialist, and a camp director with over 30 years of camp experience,
            I've seen firsthand how proper training, leadership, and culture can transform a program
            from good to life changing. I don&apos;t just teach theory—I bring{' '}
            <strong>real world experience</strong> in guiding teams, shaping inclusive policies, and
            helping professionals grow into the leaders young people need.

            Through my work at <strong>PlanetChris Consulting</strong>, I help summer camps,
            afterschool programs, and youth-serving organizations create stronger, more inclusive
            environments. My approach is hands-on, interactive, and rooted in the belief that{' '}
            <strong>when we invest in people, we build communities where everyone belongs.</strong>
          </Text>
          <Text>
            At the end of every training, I leave teams with the same message:{' '}
            <Text component="em" c="pc-denim" fw={700}>
              Love must not be rare
            </Text>
            . Because when we lead with love and make space for understanding, connection, and
            equity, we create programs that change lives.
